# Performance and Validation Report: FreshCharge+ Website

## 1. CSS Validation

The CSS stylesheet for the FreshCharge+ website was validated using the **W3C CSS Validator (CSS Level 3 + SVG)** via Direct Input.

The stylesheet **passed validation with no CSS errors**, confirming that the code is clean, accessible, and standards-compliant.

Two warnings were displayed, but they do not affect performance or rendering:
* Imported style sheets are not checked in direct-input mode.
* The `clip` property is deprecated.

These warnings are informational only and do not impact the final website.
